      <p>
        The Brain, or "Brain" for short, is a genetically enhanced laboratory
        mouse.<br />
        He wants to take over the world. For that purpose, he devises a plan
        every night with the help of his faithful companion, Pinky. <br />
        He usually fails.

          There's only one ride that interests me - the incredible thrill ride
          of taking over the world!
        </li>

          This is the earth. And this is Pinky. You can tell the difference
          quite easily. One is a lump of inert matter hurtling blindly through
